# APUSH-Companion
This app can easily help a student study for the AP US History Exam. It has over 1,500 vocabulary terms to study, plenty of review videos, and outlines to help prepare for the exam.

The original codebase was built on the Xamarin.Forms cross platform framework. However, the app gained far more traction than I expected (20,000+ downloads), so I decided to do a complete refactor and rebuilt the app in Swift.
